# Exercises from [Learn C# in One Day and Learn it Well](https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Hands-Project-Coding-Project-ebook/dp/B016Z18MLG)

I worked through this book to better understand C#. Each branch is the exercise(s) the book instructed the reader to complete. Not all chapters had exercises, Chapter 08 had several.
For that one, Each exercise is a separate branch that was merged into the master branch. The book concludes with project that I will make a separate repository.
